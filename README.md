# Objective
Code that supports the manuscript entitled, “Pancreatic cancer survival analysis defines a signature that predicts outcome”. The authors of the manuscript are Pichai Raman, Ravikanth Maddipati, MD, Kian Huat Lim, PhD, and Aydin Tozeren, PhD. The study contains original research on pancreatic cancer, integrating multiple transcriptomic data sets across different technologies to develop a predictive gene signature.

Specifically the aim of our study was to identify genes correlated with survival and differential between tumor and normal tissue. A 5-gene signature culled from this analysis was found to have significant predictive power to determine the survival of patients in multiple cohorts.
